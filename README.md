Create a navigation bar

Open /Solution/NavBar/index.html to see the final result.

2.Launch Chrome DevTools. On the Elements tab, click on the Toggle Device Mode icon to go to the device mode.

3.Click on various parts of the the device bar on the top to view the layout on different screen sizes.

4.As you can see, on mobiles, the items are listed vertically and are center-aligned. On tablets and wider screens, they are listed horizontally and pushed to the end of the navigation bar.

5.Build this navigation bar from scratch using the mobile-first approach. Make the browser small or use the device mode in DevTools to ensure the navigation bar has the right look and feel on mobile devices.

6.To change the default font, apply the following style to the body element. We’ll talk about fonts in detail later in the course. font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

7.Use media queries to re-style the navigation bar for tablets and wider screen. You can use 768px as the breakpoint. That’s a standard breakpoint for tablets.

8.Once you’re done, compare your HTML/CSS
